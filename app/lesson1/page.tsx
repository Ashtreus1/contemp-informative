				Globalization describes the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border
				trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. Countries have built economic partnerships
				to facilitate these movements over many centuries. The term gained popularity after the Cold War in the early 1990s, as these
				cooperative arrangements shaped modern everyday life.

				According to WHO , globalization can be defined as “the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of people and countries. It
				is generally understood to include two inter-related elements: the opening of international borders to increasingly fast flows of
				goods, services, finance, people and ideas; and the changes in institutions and policies at national and international levels that
				facilitate or promote such flows.”
